# Data Modeling with Postgres

## Who Will Benefit From This Project?

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app.

## What Are Your Goals and Objectives?

1.- To reate a Postgres DB schema and ETL pipeline to get tables designed for optimizing queeries on song play analysis, so we will focus on develop and complete different scripts that are described below. 

2.- The analytics team wants to know, what songs users are listening to?

## what is the purpuse of each script?

* test.ipynb displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your db.
* create_tables.py to drop, creates, or reset your tables.
* etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables.
* etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables.
* sql_queries.py contains all your sql queries.
* README.md General description of this project.

## how to run the Python scripts?

In release order

1.-> In a terminal type "python create_tables.py" to create your database and tables.

2.-> In a terminal type "python etl.py" ETL processes for each table.

3.-> To display all tables open test.ipynb and run all cells.

## Process:

1.-
